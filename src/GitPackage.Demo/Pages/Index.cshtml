  # GitPackage wiki
 
  GitPackage aims to use Git Repositories in a similar way as NuGet packages.

  ## Why? 
  Sometimes I just want to share a few lines of code between projects.
  
  These little code blocks are often too small to warrant creating a nuget package.
  
  I use this approach so I could easily share code, without significant overhead or complexity.
  
  
  ## Limitations

  This is **NOT** a full-fledged package manager.

  There's no inter-package dependencies, and it only handles simple version strings.

  This simplicity makes it far easier to understand how GitPackage behaves; at the expense of more robust
  package management tasks.

  ## When to use GitPackage

  Use a GitPackage for sharing small code bits, that aren't big enough for their own a Assembly / nuget package.

  For instance, one of my favorites is a couple of classes I use to provide extensions to FileInfo and
  DirectoryInfo.

  Way too small for the over-head of a nuget package, but just right for source-code sharing.
