  ## How it works
  A custom build task is used to manage the **GitPackages**

  On restore (build) the main Target **GitPackRestore** is used

  1. Current data from project's gist folder is read.
  2. **Clone** any missing repository's to local cache folder (HOME/.gitpack)
  3. **Fetch** if local clone doesn't have Version (tag).
  4. Delete current project gists that don't match.
  5. **add workspace** in project for each package; using Version tag.

  An MSBuild task written in CSharp loads current file-system data for easier use in MSBuild.

  A couple of other targets are used to link into the build process.

  1. gpAutoRestore - Before restore, run **GitPackRestore**
  2. gpAutoRestoreInVStudio - If in Visual studio, run before build.
